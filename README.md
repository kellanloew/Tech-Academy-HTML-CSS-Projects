# Tech-Academy-HTML-CSS-Projects
In these projects, I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to make fully functional front end websites.
In the Space Station site, I used exclusively HTML and CSS to create and style the pages.
The Cinema site focused primarily on using Bootstrap.
The Pizza Website leverages JavaScript to update the page dynamically according to user input.
